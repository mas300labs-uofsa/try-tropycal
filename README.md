# Trying tropical

Python package 'tropycal' looks promising and I want to try it out.  Since it has a slew of dependencies, I am making a new
repo so that the other notebooks don't need all those packages in their environment.

tropycal
- https://tropycal.github.io/tropycal/index.html

dependencies
- matplotlib >= 2.2.2
- numpy >= 1.14.3
- scipy >= 1.1.0
- pandas >= 0.23.0
- xarray >= 0.10.7
- networkx >= 2.0.0
- pyshp >= 2.1
- cartopy >= 0.17.0

And the environment will also have:
- tropycal
